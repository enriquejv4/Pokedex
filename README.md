# Pokedex
### Postgres' database from pokeapi generated by python

In this python program I'm scraping the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) web page.
I'm scraping 1010 Json files. Each Json file contains all information for each pokemon.

Python code will extract selected information for each of these Json files and create a postgres database.
In this python code, from line 6 to line 16, we are connecting to a postgres database through **hidden.py**.

The file **hidden.py** is a python code that only contains a function with your postgre's database connection info.

```
def secrets(): 
    return {"host": "********",
            "port": ****,
            "database": "*********",
            "user": "*********",
            "pass": "*****"}
```

From lines 18 to 29 we just defining two help functions.

From lines 31 to 43 we are creating a table with the columns we wish.

Finally, from lines 45 to 56 a for bucle fill the database's columns.
